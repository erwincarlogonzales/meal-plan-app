# Meal Plan App 🍴  
Version 2  

## Why I Built This 🛠️  
Let's be real—meal planning can feel like a **never-ending chore**. Every day, it's the same questions:  
- *What should I cook?* 🍳  
- *What meals work for the week?* 🗓️  
- *What groceries do I need?* 🛒  

I was done with the stress and mental gymnastics, so I built the **Meal Plan App** to simplify the whole process. With this app, I can easily:  
- Plan meals in advance ✅  
- Keep track of ingredients 🥕🍗  
- Save time and effort on grocery shopping ⏳  

The **best part**? I deployed this app on **Vercel** because it's free, and yes, I'm broke—but that won't stop me from creating awesome tools to solve real problems! 🚀💪

## Why Should You Care 🤝
1. Honestly, you shouldn't.
2. I just build **practical solutions** for my own problems.
2. Use **modern web technologies** like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
3. Deploy and manage production-ready apps on **platforms like Vercel**.
4. Deliver clean, reusable, and scalable code.
